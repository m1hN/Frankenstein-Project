    <p>My real name is Dorothy. I will tell you the truth for the answer that you are seeking. In the image that John Doe posted was an image crafted by me. I wanted people to notice me. I am a great artist however with the looks that I was born with, it hasn't been the easiest. At school being picked on was a daily occurence, yet it never occured to me the reason until a while back. People started to call me slurs; </p>
        <p>"Zombie face," "skeleton," "roasted salami," "deranged," "one leg..." "Frankenstein."</p>
    <p>I hated that.</p>
    <p>I had the skill to be an artist.</p>
    <p>Turning 16, I was ready to get a part-time job, but all they did was laugh at me when I'm not looking, or moved away from me, like I was some... monster.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My mother was a single mom, having to support me during my adolencence. Carrying me around in a wheelchair, since I can't walk normally. I was born with a defect, one leg is significantly shorter than my normal one. All the other girls were playing with each other, while I was always alone. Tag was a game I adore, being able to run with... others. However, whenever I try, I always fall down, hurting so much on the inside that I can't- just... get back up.</p>
    <p>At this point, my mother had given all hope on me. She couldn't keep supporting me, especially since we were never financially well. What pushed her to leave me was well... people. She couldn't keep living a life where other mothers were shunning her. I was never invited because of my looks and my mother like me, was all alone.</p>
    <p>I understand why she left me.</p>
    <p>Yet why.</p>
    <p>Isn't a mother supposed to have uncondional love for her child?</p>
    <p>I'm her child!!</p>
    <br>
    <p>With no where to go, I went to the library.</p>
    <p>That's where I read a book called Frankenstein.</p>
    <p>Reading through the story, I closely relate to the monster. His creator, the one who was supposed to take responsibility for his creation, just left! Like mine! Oh how life such parrallels that of this monster! No one to call as friends nor family. Truly alone. I wanted to push punishments towards all those that treated like filth... just like the monster. However, my body isn't meant for such tasks. In the end the monster killed himself by burning himself.</p>
    <p>I've been asked whether i've been in a fire before with such sinister smiles. laughing at my face.</p>
    <p>Maybe I will.</p>
    <p>Fire burns so bright and such heat, yet so beautiful. </p>
    <p>They say hell is the land of fire but wouldn't it be the most beautiful place of all?</p>
    <p>I wouldn't mind showering in such warmth.</p>
    <p>The only warmth.</p>
    <p>Away from this cold world.</p>
    <br>
